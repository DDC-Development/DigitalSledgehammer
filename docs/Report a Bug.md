# How to report a bug

If you've found a bug, or some other kind of issue with DigitalSledgehammer, then you might choose to be helpful and report it. If this is the case, let's preface this with a thank you â€“ reporting bugs is the quickest way for the community to let developers know of an issue, and helps them get on the way to that _"perfect piece of software"_ that we all dream about. 

To report a bug, go to `https://github.com/DDC-Development/DigitalSledgehammer`, and click on the _Issues_ tab. In the top right, you'll see a green button that says "New Issue". In the form that will appear, give a short title explaining what's wrong in ideally 7 words or less, and then in the largest box, specify the issue in as much detail as you can. Note that Markdown is supported here. When you're done, click _Submit new issue_, and your issue will be made public, ready for the developers to fix.
